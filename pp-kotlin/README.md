# PP, Kotlin

This solution uses Procedural Programming - i.e. just simple functions to solve the problem. The solution is written in Kotlin.

All data is _immutable_. All functions are pure, except the implementation that writes to the console.

Here we also excersize the use of modules (api + implementation); which may be a bit overkill for this problem, but it's a good example of the idea. The `boot` module combines the modules and defines the implementation.
