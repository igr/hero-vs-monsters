# Go

This solution uses the Go language, so please [install Go +1.20](https://go.dev/doc/install) before running it.

The command line accepts just one single argument: the path to the input file, which has to include the TXT file extension. Otherwise, it will print an error message and exit.

```bash
go run . ../game1.txt
```
